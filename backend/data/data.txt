TITLE: Samples
============================================================

The samples referred to in the Agriculture Article, §
11-409, Annotated Code of
Maryland, may be either fresh or time composite. Immediately before any sample
is drawn from any container, the contents of the container from which it is
drawn shall be thoroughly mixed for a minimum of 5 minutes. A weigh tank, farm
milk tank, or other container from which a sample is to be drawn may not have
any partition, division, or strainer which divides it, in any way, into more
than one compartment. Each sample shall be put into a container of a type,
labeled and stored in a manner, and at a temperature specified by the
Secretary. Samples shall, at all times, be under the control of a person
licensed as a weigher and sampler or as a weigher, sampler, and tester by the
Procedures-Fresh Samples. When fresh samples (as opposed to time composite
samples) are obtained for possible use as the basis of milk fat percentage
determinations for producer payment, a representative sample shall be obtained
and labeled in a manner approved by the Secretary. The representative sample
will be drawn at the time milk is obtained from each producer's farm milk tank,
but only by a person licensed under these regulations by the Secretary. A
licensee will deliver the sample, with the producer's product, to the

licensee uses fresh samples, a representative sample shall be tested at least 3
times each month for each producer. The sample shall be tested within a period
of 1 day after being drawn, if possible, but never later than 3 days after
initially being obtained by a licensee. The residue of the representative
sample shall be held on the premises where tested in a manner to maintain it
suitable for any testing by the Secretary for an additional period of not less
than 2 working days. Fresh representative samples shall be of such size that
the residue, for any test by the Secretary, shall be sufficient to make two

Procedures-Time Composite Samples. When using time composite samples as the
basis of determination for producer payment, a representative fresh sample will
be drawn at the time milk is obtained from each producer's farm milk tank and

regulations. A portion of the representative fresh sample shall be incorporated
into an acceptable composite bottle and properly maintained at the appropriate
stationary receiving station. The proportionate amount of the representative
fresh sample incorporated into the composite bottle each day of shipment will
be governed by the relative amount of milk shipped by the producer each day so
that an accurate proportion will be established in the time composite
When using or developing time composite samples, a representative and correctly
proportionate sample shall be taken from each delivery of each producer (as
indicated in §F, above) and shall encompass a period of not more than 16
days. The samples shall contain the correct amount and kind of preservative
prescribed by the Secretary. The time encompassed by these composite samples
shall be the same for all producers at the same stationary receiving station.
All time composite samples shall be tested within 3 working days following the
close of the period encompassed by the samples. After all time composite
samples have been tested, their residue shall be held on the premises where
tested and in a manner to maintain them suitable for testing by the Secretary.
These samples shall be held and properly maintained for a period of not less
than 7 days. Time composite samples shall be of such adequate size that the

attached to the bottle. Attaching the stopper to the bottle by means of a chain
or collar is acceptable. Whenever time composite samples are used, the
composite bottle shall be of more than sufficient capacity to contain the total
volume of the daily proportionate amount of representative samples for the
maximum number of days encompassed by the time composite sample. The composite
bottle shall be of a type that can be tightly stoppered so as to prevent
evaporation or the entrance of water and may not contain a recessed pouring

Maryland to be classified as a scrapie consistent state under 9 CFR, Part 79 .
Scrapie consistent status not only enhances the well-being of the State's sheep
and goat industry by protecting against scrapie but also helps ensure the most
favorable treatment possible for Maryland sheep and goat producers in any
market. Sheep and goat producers electing to participate in the U.S. Scrapie

SECTION: 15.15.01.01
TITLE: General
============================================================

The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Program was
created by the Maryland General Assembly to preserve productive agricultural
land and woodland which provides for the continued production of food and fiber
for the citizens of the State. This program is administered by the Board of
Trustees of the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (the
Foundation). The preservation of agricultural land will curb the spread of
urban sprawl and protect agricultural land and woodland as open space

SECTION: 15.15.01.01-1
TITLE: Program Summary
============================================================

Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation program is voluntary on the part of
landowners and is dependent upon the cooperation of local government. This
program requires local governments to appoint agricultural preservation
advisory boards that assist in the creation of agricultural preservation
districts where the subdivision and development of land is restricted by
agreement between the landowner and the Agricultural Land Preservation
Foundation, and where agricultural and woodland production activities are
encouraged and protected. If a landowner requests that this property be
included in a district, that property must meet minimum criteria as established
by the Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation. If an easement has not been
sold to the Foundation, a landowner may terminate after 5 years his property's
inclusion in a district. Notice to terminate must be given 1 year in advance of
landowner who includes his land within a district will receive the following
normal agricultural activities from nuisance complaints; and
sell an agricultural land preservation easement to the Foundation.
C. Once land is in an agricultural
preservation district, a landowner may make application to sell an easement to
the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation. The application will
indicate the price of any easement offered. The maximum value of this easement
is determined as the difference between the land's agricultural use value and
its fair market value as determined by appraisals. However, the Foundation has
the discretion to select those easements which it shall purchase. Purchased
easements may be reviewed after a 25-year period, and if profitable farming is
found not to be feasible, an easement may be terminated by

TITLE: Explanation of Formula for Determining Agricultural Value
============================================================

Md. Code Regs. 15.15.02.05 - Explanation of Formula for Determining Agricultural Value
A. Formula's Underlying Premise. The
agricultural value of the land on which the landowner has applied to sell an
easement shall be determined by the formula provided under Regulation .06. This
formula, which measures the farm productivity of the applicant's land, provides
a method for ascertaining the capitalized value of the sum necessary to rent
the applicant's farm. (The formula's premise is that the capitalized value of
cash rents paid for land is a reliable indicator of the land's agricultural
value.) The formula numerically explains how certain factors such as a farm's

who rented land revealed a strong relationship between rent and soil types,
that is, the greater a land's natural productivity, the greater the rent paid
for that land (and per the formula's premise, the greater the agricultural
value of the land). As explained in Regulation .07, a land's natural
productivity is measured in terms of a soil productivity index. This index is
based on the natural characteristics of each soil class and how these
also revealed a relationship between rent and a farm's location, that is, the
greater a farm's average distance from Baltimore and Washington, up to 100
miles, the greater the rent paid for that land (and per the formula's premise,
the greater the agricultural value of the land). Beyond 100 miles, the
relationship between rent and a farm's location was not significant.
Affect Rent. From the results of this survey, a mathematical equation was
developed which effectively estimates how a farm's soil types and location
would affect its rent. Being able to effectively estimate how these factors
would affect a farm's rent (and consequently, per the formula's premise, how
they would affect a farm's agricultural value), this equation forms a major
step in the Department's formula for determining agricultural value. The
mathematical equation is as follows: Rent = -53 + (160 X productivity index) +
(0.11 X average distance from Baltimore and Washington, up to 100 miles). The
equation, however, is only effective for estimating rental values greater than
$25 per acre. For this reason, under the Department's formula for determining
agricultural value, $25 per acre constitutes the minimum per acre rental value
Relationship Between Rent and Soil Types. The chart indicated in Regulation .08
is useful to understand the relationship between rent and soil types. A visual
inspection reveals that rents tend to be greater for higher soil productivity
indexes. Mathematical methods are used to generalize this relationship into a
statistically "best fit" formula shown by the formula line on the graph. The
-53 in the equation represents the point where the formula line crosses the
rent axis on the graph. It has no practical meaning except to fit the formula
line to the data. The 160 in the equation represents the formula line's slope.
It means that for each increase of 0.10 in the soil productivity index of a
The relationship between rent and location of this equation can be similarly
explained. The 0.11 in the equation means that for every mile increase in
average distance that the applicant's land is from Baltimore and Washington, up
$25 minimum rent value line indicates that the equation is only effective for
estimating rents within the range of the data. In those few cases when, under
the equation, a land's rental value is estimated to be less than $25 per acre,

SECTION: 15.15.02.06
TITLE: Formula for Determining Agricultural Value
============================================================

Md. Code Regs. 15.15.02.06 - Formula for Determining Agricultural Value
To determine the agricultural value of the land on which the
landowner has applied to sell an easement, complete the following five
A. Step 1. Using the following
method, determine the soil productivity index of the parcel of land on which
the applicant has applied to sell an easement. First, note how many acres of
cultivatable land (Class I through VI soils) are contained in this parcel.
Second, determine how many of these acres consist of Class I soils. Third,
using the table found in Regulation .07 of this chapter, multiply the number of
acres of Class I soils by the soil productivity index for Class I soils. Having
completed the calculation process for Class I soils, follow the same process
for Class II through Class VI soils. Next, add each of these calculations
together. Finally, divide this sum by the total number of acres of cultivatable
land contained in the entire parcel. This figure equals the soil productivity
index of the applicant's parcel. (For example, if the applicant's parcel
consists of 60 acres of Class II soils and 40 acres of Class III soils, the
following calculations must be made: 60 acres X 0.72 = 43.20; 40 acres X 0.50 =
20; 43.20 + 20 = 63.20; 63.20 divided by 100 acres = 0.632. The soil
productivity index of the applicant's parcel in this example equals 0.632.) Use
B. Step 2. Determine the average distance the
applicant's land is from Baltimore and Washington. First, note the distance
this land is from Baltimore. Second, note the land's distance from Washington,
D.C. To obtain the land's average distance from Baltimore and Washington, add
these two distances together and divide by 2. (For example, if the applicant's
land is 50 miles from Washington and 20 miles from Baltimore, its average
distance from these areas is 35 miles. (50 + 20) divided by 2 = 35.) Use this
Step 3. Using the mathematical equation discussed in Regulation .05 of this
chapter, determine the per acre rental value of the applicant's land. That
equation is as follows: Rent = -53 + (160 X productivity index) + (0.11 x
average distance from Baltimore and Washington, up to 100 miles). Insert the
figures derived from completing Steps 1 and 2 to complete the equation. The
productivity index number is the figure derived from completing Step 1. The
average distance is the figure derived from completing Step 2. If the average
distance is 100 miles or more, insert 100 into the equation. (Using the figures
from the examples noted in Steps 1 and 2, the equation is completed as follows:
Rent = -53 + (160 X 0.632) + (0.11 X 35) or, to answer the equation, $51.97 per
acre.) Use this calculation or the most recent 5-year average cash rent of the
county where the property is located, whichever is lower, to complete Step 4.
If the rental value calculated in Step 3 or if the running 5-year average cash
rent of the county is less than $25 per acre, use $25 per acre to complete Step
acre agricultural value of the applicant's land, divide the figure derived from
completing Step 3 (the per acre rental value of the applicant's land) by a
capitalization rate of 6 percent (the Department has estimated 6 percent to be
the capitalization rate). (Using the figure from the example noted in Step 3,
or $51.97 per acre, the per acre agricultural value is $742.43 ($51.97 divided
by 0.06).) Use this figure to complete the final step.

B. An easement may be reviewed for possible
termination 25 years after the purchase of the easement, but only if the Board
of Public Works approved the easement for purchase before October 1, 2004,
unless the right to apply to terminate the easement has been waived in the deed
C. As Agriculture Article, §
2-514, Annotated Code of

county governing body where the land is located. Similar to when an easement is
purchased, the Foundation and the county have separate duties and
responsibilities when reviewing an easement for possible termination. In the
case of easement termination, the county's responsibility is to consider
factors relating to local land use policies, while the Foundation's separate
responsibility is to determine whether future profitable farming is feasible on
the land under easement. The Foundation may only approve the termination if it
finds that future profitable farming is not feasible. If either the county or
the Foundation deny any termination request, an easement may not be

All of the land subject to an agricultural land preservation
easement acquired by the Foundation is considered to be one parcel of land even
if the total acreage comprises separately described parcels or
government-assigned tax parcels or accounts. Common ownership of parcels
constituting the farm fulfills the legislative intent to protect the future
productivity and profitability of Maryland farms. To preserve the integrity of
easement land, agricultural land preservation easements generally preclude a
landowner from dividing the farm into smaller parcels or conveying less than
the whole farm subject to easement without Foundation

Agricultural Subdivision. The Foundation may give written approval to a
landowner's request for an agricultural subdivision of the land and separate
ownership of the resulting divided parcels for reasons the Foundation considers
sufficiently extraordinary to justify an exception to the prohibition against
subdivision. The approval for an agricultural subdivision is not an absolute
right of a landowner, and requests shall be reviewed by the Foundation on a
case-by-case basis to determine if, in the Foundation's opinion:
The proposed agricultural subdivision will enhance or have no effect upon the
agricultural operations being conducted upon the land; and

C. Corrective Easements. If the Foundation
approves an agricultural subdivision under this Chapter, approval shall be to
accommodate a plan that the Foundation has determined will benefit the
agricultural operation as required by Agriculture Article, §
2-513, Annotated Code of
Maryland, and COMAR 15.15.11. Corrective easements are required to formalize
the Foundation's approval. The corrective easements may include other
additional terms, conditions, waivers, or restrictions that the Foundation
considers appropriate to protect the agricultural purpose and the future
profitability of resulting divided farm parcels. The landowner shall pay for
the cost of all title work, title insurance premiums, surveys, and
documentation necessary to complete the agricultural subdivision.
For easements approved for purchase by the Board of Public Works prior to
October 1, 2004, the owners of all of the resulting divided parcels of an
approved agricultural subdivision under this chapter shall waive the right to

employed when a soil sample analysis shows a phosphorus fertility index value
("P FIV") of 150 or greater Unless the transition schedule is adjusted as
provided in this chapter, the Phosphorus Management Tool will be phased-in over
a 7-year period as shown in the chart found in Regulation .10 of this chapter
Farms that have excess soil phosphorus will be placed in one of three tiers, as
determined by the particular operation's average phosphorus fertility index
value. Farms with an average P FIV of 450 and greater will be the first
operations required to begin implementing the Phosphorus Management Tool but
will be given a longer time-frame to fully implement it Farms with an average P
FIV of (1) 150 and greater, but less than 300, and (2) 300 and greater, but
less than 450, will be required to begin implementing the Phosphorus Management
